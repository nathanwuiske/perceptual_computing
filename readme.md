# Playing card recognition

This program implements two different playing card recognition methods using the same detection process. The first of which being an absolute difference and the second being feature matching using SIFT to create descriptors to be matched with K-nearest neighbours with ratio testing

## TODO

* Improve card detection to support occlusion
* Update the way the initial deck is stored in data structure
